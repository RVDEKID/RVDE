<h2> About me</h2>
<div class="horizontal-line"> </div>
<p>   A versatile creative professional with a deep 
      passion and extensive background in digital art 
      and visual communication.
      <br style="margin-bottom: 2px;"> 
      Since my teenage years, my main hobby has been exploring and mastering new 
      visual software and techniques, with over 12 years of 
      near-daily experience, especially with Adobe programs. 
      Music and audio production have also been lifelong interests. 
      <br style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Currently, the gaming industry is one of my biggest passions, 
      where I’ve gained a strong familiarity not only with programming 
      in Unreal Engine and Unity but also with animating and creating 
      3D models into game environments over the years.</p>

            <p> My own freelance gig in graphic design and illustration. I have gained clients from 
                  around the world, both through Instagram inquiries and the Fiverr platform. 
                  The main form of illustration has been digital painting, ranging from album covers
                   and branded apparel to basic portraits.  </p>

            </div>
            <p> I worked at Seven-1 for 4 months as a work trainee/part-time employee, 
                  with main responsibilities in web design and graphic design. 
                  During this time, I built three websites using WordPress and Divi Builder: 
                  Itä-Lapin Kuntayhtymä, Herkkukonttori, and the upcoming site for Lapponia Tours Oy.
                  I also created 3D models for various projects, including the interior/exterior 3D model 
                  for marketing renders of a development involving exclusive accommodations. 
                  Additionally, I designed the UI/UX for an upcoming AI chatbot using Preact, 
                  with TypeScript and CSS.  </p>

      <p> I worked as a graphic designer at Painatuskeskus for just over a year. From the start, 
            I took on a key role, and my responsibilities quickly expanded. I was involved in every 
            stage of the printing process, from design to production, whether it was apparel printing,
             window decals and their installation, magazine layout, or printing posters and brochures.
              The physical side of graphic design is something I am extremely familiar with. I was 
              also responsible for training new employees and, when necessary, assisting with sales,
               client relations, and marketing.  </p>
